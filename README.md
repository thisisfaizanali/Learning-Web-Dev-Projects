Welcome to my Web Development Tutorials Projects repository! This folder contains a collection of small projects and exercises that I created while learning the fundamentals of web development. Each project is designed to focus on a specific concept or skill, making it a practical and hands-on way to reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned.
