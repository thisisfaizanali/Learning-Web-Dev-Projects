Welcome to my Web Development Tutorials Projects repository! This folder contains a collection of small projects and exercises that I created while learning the fundamentals of web development. Each project is designed to focus on a specific concept or skill, making it a practical and hands-on way to reinforce what I’ve learned.

Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to document my progress and serve as a reference for key web development topics. These projects cover a range of technologies and techniques, reflecting the steps I’ve taken in my learning journey.
